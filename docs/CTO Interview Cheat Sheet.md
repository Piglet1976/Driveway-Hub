## Questions YOU Should Ask the CTO Candidate

### Technical Architecture & Experience

**Q: "Looking at our tech stack - Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, React, Tesla Fleet API, Stripe Connect - what's your experience with these technologies?"**
- *What to listen for: Specific project examples, depth of knowledge, comfort level*
- *Red flags: Vague answers, no real-world experience, overconfidence*

- *What to listen for: Understanding of real-time systems, WebSockets, event-driven architecture*
- *Good signs: Mentions caching, rate limiting, error handling*

**Q: "Our Smart Auto-Park feature requires precise coordination between booking, payment, and vehicle control. Walk me through how you'd architect this workflow."**
- *What to listen for: System design thinking, error handling, transaction management*
- *Red flags: Oversimplified approach, ignoring failure scenarios*

### Security & Compliance

**Q: "We're handling payment data, vehicle access, and location tracking. What security measures would you implement?"**

- *What to listen for: Database design, caching strategies, microservices thinking*
- *Red flags: "We'll worry about that later" attitude*

**Q: "Parking discovery needs to be real-time - drivers expect instant results. How would you optimize for speed?"**
- *What to listen for: Geospatial indexing, caching, CDN usage*
- *Good signs: Mentions PostGIS, Redis, location-based optimization*

### Development Process

**Q: "Given our 12-week MVP timeline, how would you structure the development sprints?"**

## Questions THEY Will Ask You (Be Ready!)

### Business & Market

**Q: "What's your go-to-market strategy beyond the Tesla integration?"**
**Your Answer:** *"Tesla integration is our competitive moat, but we're building a platform that can expand to other EVs. We're starting with San Francisco's high parking demand, then scaling to other dense cities. Our residential focus taps into underutilized inventory that traditional parking apps miss."*

**Q: "How do you plan to acquire hosts and drivers?"**
**Your Answer:** *"We have a growing email list from our landing page. For hosts, we're targeting neighborhoods with high Tesla density. For drivers, we're leveraging Tesla owner communities and our unique value proposition of fully automated parking."*

**Q: "What's the revenue model and how do you plan to monetize?"**
**Your Answer:** *"15% platform fee on all transactions. Hosts keep 85%, we handle all payments, insurance, and customer support. Secondary revenue from premium features like EV charging integration and covered parking."*

### Technical Challenges

**Q: "What happens if Tesla's auto-park feature fails?"**
**Your Answer:** *"We have multiple fallback layers: manual override capabilities, detailed logging for liability, and insurance coverage. Our system monitors each parking attempt and can abort if sensors detect issues. We're also building partnerships with insurance providers for comprehensive coverage."*

**Q: "How do you handle edge cases like blocked driveways or incorrect locations?"**
**Your Answer:** *"Photo verification before each booking, real-time availability checking, and GPS validation. We also have a dispute resolution system and maintain security deposits. Our Tesla integration provides precise location data to minimize these issues."*

**Q: "What's your plan for regulatory compliance across different cities?"**
**Your Answer:** *"We're building a compliance framework that checks local zoning laws before listing approval. Starting with San Francisco lets us perfect our legal approach before expanding. We're also working with legal counsel on sharing economy regulations."*

### Team & Equity

**Q: "What equity are you offering for the CTO role?"**
**Your Answer:** *"I'm looking for a true co-founder, not just an employee. We can discuss equity split based on contribution - I bring the business vision, Tesla partnership, and initial validation. You bring the technical expertise to build it. Let's talk about what feels fair based on our respective contributions."*

**Q: "What's your technical background?"**
**Your Answer:** *"I'm business-focused with enough technical knowledge to understand the architecture and requirements. That's why I need a technical co-founder - someone who can own the entire technical stack while I focus on business development, partnerships, and market strategy."*

**Q: "How do you handle technical decisions when you disagree?"**
**Your Answer:** *"I trust technical experts in their domain. My job is to communicate business requirements clearly and let you architect the best solution. If there are tradeoffs between features and timeline, we'll discuss priorities together."*

### Company Vision

**Q: "Where do you see this company in 5 years?"**
**Your Answer:** *"Driveway-Hub becomes the standard for residential parking across all EVs. We expand beyond parking to become a comprehensive 'sharing economy for driveways' - EV charging, car washing, even autonomous vehicle staging. Our Tesla integration is the foundation for a much larger platform."*

**Q: "What's your fundraising timeline?"**
**Your Answer:** *"We're bootstrapping through MVP and initial traction. Once we hit our 90-day goals (50+ hosts, 200+ drivers, first revenue), we'll raise a seed round. Having a strong technical co-founder will significantly strengthen our fundraising position."*
