# Tesla Integration Plan

## Integration Status
âœ… **Tesla Fleet API Access Approved** - June 29, 2025
- Application ID: [Your Tesla App ID]
- API Scopes: Vehicle Information, Vehicle Location, Vehicle Commands
- Developer Status: Active

## Technical Architecture

### Phase 1: Basic Tesla Connection
- **Timeline:** Months 1-3
- **Scope:** Connect to Tesla API, read vehicle data
- **Features:**
  - Vehicle location tracking
  - Basic vehicle information
  - User authentication with Tesla account

### Phase 2: Navigation Integration
- **Timeline:** Months 4-6  
- **Scope:** Send destinations to Tesla vehicles
- **Features:**
  - Share parking location to Tesla navigation
  - Route optimization
  - Estimated arrival times

### Phase 3: Smart Auto-Park
- **Timeline:** Months 7-12
- **Scope:** Fully automated parking experience
- **Features:**
  - Automatic driveway discovery
  - Intelligent booking algorithm
  - Real-time arrival detection
  - In-car notifications

## API Integration Points

### Tesla Fleet API Endpoints
1. **Vehicle List** - `/api/1/vehicles`
2. **Vehicle Location** - `/api/1/vehicles/{id}/data_request/drive_state`
3. **Share Destination** - `/api/1/vehicles/{id}/command/share_destination`
4. **Vehicle State** - `/api/1/vehicles/{id}/data_request/vehicle_state`

### Smart Auto-Park Algorithm
1. User sets destination in Tesla
2. DrivewayHub finds available driveways within 0.5 mile radius
3. Algorithm scores driveways based on:
   - Distance to destination (40% weight)
   - Price (30% weight)
   - Host rating (20% weight)
   - Availability window (10% weight)
4. Auto-book optimal driveway
5. Send navigation to Tesla
6. Set up geofence for arrival detection

## Security & Privacy
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with Tesla
- Encrypted API communications
- User consent for vehicle data access
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Data retention policies

## Testing Strategy
1. **Sandbox Testing** - Tesla's development environment
2. **Beta Testing** - Limited group of Tesla owners
3. **Phased Rollout** - Gradual expansion to full user base

## Risk Mitigation
- **Tesla API Changes** - Monitor Tesla developer updates
- **Rate Limiting** - Implement proper API call management
- **Fallback Options** - Manual booking if auto-park fails
- **User Education** - Clear onboarding for Tesla integration

## Success Metrics
- 90%+ successful auto-park completions
- <30 second average booking time
- 95%+ user satisfaction with Tesla integration
- Zero security incidents

## Future Expansion
- BMW ConnectedDrive integration
- Mercedes me integration
- Other smart car manufacturers
- Autonomous vehicle preparation
