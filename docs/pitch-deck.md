# Driveway-Hub Pitch Deck

## 1. Vision
Driveway-Hub aims to revolutionize urban parking by connecting Tesla owners with driveway hosts, leveraging Tesla’s Fleet API for smart auto-parking. Our goal is to reduce parking stress in cities like San Francisco, starting with a beta launch by Q4 2025.

## 2. Problem
- **Parking Scarcity**: Urban areas face a 20% parking space deficit (AAA, 2023).
- **Tesla Integration Gap**: No platform fully utilizes Tesla’s auto-parking for peer-to-peer parking.
- **Time Waste**: Drivers spend 17 hours annually searching for parking (INRIX, 2023).

## 3. Solution
- **Platform**: A web and mobile app where Tesla owners book driveways, with auto-parking via Tesla Fleet API.
- **Features**: Real-time availability, secure payments (Stripe), and host earnings.
- **MVP**: Focus on San Francisco, targeting 100+ survey responses for market validation.

## 4. Market Opportunity
- **Target Market**: 1.8M Tesla owners (Tesla Q1 2025 report) and 30M urban households with unused driveways (U.S. Census).
- **Revenue**: 15% platform fee per booking, scalable to $1M ARR by 2026.
- **Competitors**: SpotHero (commercial lots), Neighbor (storage focus)—we’re unique with Tesla integration.

## 5. Technical Foundation
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL 14 (PostGIS), Redis, Docker, React Native.
- **Development**: Dockerized environment with `/database/schema.sql` (users, driveways, bookings).
- **API**: `POST /bookings/create` endpoint, ready for CTO candidate testing.

## 6. Marketing Strategy
- **YouTube Teaser**: Pac-Man-themed video showcasing Tesla auto-parking, targeting Tesla communities.
- **X Outreach**: Hashtags (#Tesla, #SmartParking) to drive 100+ survey responses.
- **Goal**: Build brand awareness and validate demand pre-launch.

## 7. Next Steps
- **CTO Onboarding**: Evaluate candidate (Britton) with technical challenge by July 18, 2025.
- **Beta Launch**: San Francisco pilot by Q4 2025.
- **Funding**: Seek $500K seed round post-validation.
