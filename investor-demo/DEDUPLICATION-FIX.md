# ✅ Fixed: Tesla Demo Event Deduplication

## Issue Resolved
The duplicate notification issue in the Live Event Stream has been successfully fixed!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Added Deduplication Logic**
- Implemented a 5-second deduplication window in the `addEvent` function
- Events with identical messages within 5 seconds are now automatically filtered out
- Added memory management to prevent the deduplication map from growing indefinitely

### 2. **Fixed Timing Logic**
- Changed from time ranges (e.g., `elapsed > 10 && elapsed < 12`) to specific timestamps
- Added `processedEventsRef` to track which events have already been triggered
- Each event now fires exactly once at its designated time

### 3. **Enhanced Event Variety**
- **Setup Phase** (0-30s): 6 unique events including OAuth, API connection, vehicle detection
- **Booking Phase** (30-120s): 10 unique events from search to payment processing
- **Journey Phase** (120-600s): 15+ varied events including milestones, speed updates, traffic info
- **Arrival Phase** (600-660s): 9 detailed events from arrival to charging initiation
- **Complete Phase** (660s+): Final success confirmation

## Event Progression Timeline

- 630s: "Host Ruth notified - Guest has arrived"
- 640s: "Charging in progress - Adding 44 km/hour"
- 650s: "Journey analytics saved"

## Technical Implementation

### Deduplication Function
```typescript
const addEvent = (category, type, message, details) => {
  // Check if same message was added within 5 seconds
  const now = Date.now();
  const lastTime = lastEventMessagesRef.current.get(message);
  
  if (lastTime && (now - lastTime) < 5000) {
    return; // Skip duplicate
  }
  
  // Update last event time and add new event
  lastEventMessagesRef.current.set(message, now);
  // ... create and add event
}
```

### Event Tracking
```typescript
if (Math.floor(elapsed) === 10 && !processedEventsRef.current.has('setup_10')) {
  addEvent('Tesla', 'success', 'Tesla OAuth completed successfully');
  processedEventsRef.current.add('setup_10');
}
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Duplicates**: Each event appears exactly once
2. **Realistic Progression**: Events flow naturally through phases
3. **Rich Variety**: Over 40 unique events throughout the demo
4. **Professional Presentation**: Clean event stream for investors
5. **Memory Efficient**: Automatic cleanup of old tracking data

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Open http://localhost:3001
2. Click "▶️ Start Live Demo"
3. Watch the Live Event Stream (right panel)
4. Confirm each event appears only once
5. Verify events progress through all phases smoothly

## Result

The investor demo now shows a professional, realistic progression of events that accurately simulates a Tesla journey from booking to arrival, with no duplicate notifications!
