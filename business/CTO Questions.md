

**1. "How do you handle liability and insurance when someone's car is parked in a stranger's driveway?"**
*Answer:* We're partnering with specialized insurance providers who already cover peer-to-peer vehicle sharing (like Turo's model). Homeowners are covered under our platform insurance during active rentals, and we require all drivers to maintain comprehensive coverage. We also implement verification systems - background checks, driving records, and vehicle inspections through our Tesla integration.

**2. "What's your unit economics? How much do you take per transaction and what are your customer acquisition costs?"**
*Answer:* We take 20% commission (15% from homeowner, 5% from driver) - competitive with Airbnb's model. Average transaction is $25/day, so $5 per booking. Our CAC is low because we're targeting Tesla owners directly through Tesla forums, supercharger locations, and referral programs. LTV is high due to daily commuter usage patterns.

**3. "Tesla's API access is great, but what if they change their terms or cut you off?"**
*Answer:* Valid concern. That's why we're building the core marketplace functionality to be vehicle-agnostic from day one. Tesla integration is our competitive moat for launch, but the underlying platform works with any smart parking system. We're also building relationships with other OEMs simultaneously - just launching with Tesla first.

**4. "How do you scale supply? Getting homeowners to list their driveways seems like the harder side of the marketplace."**
*Answer:* We start in high-density commuter areas where demand is obvious - near train stations, airports, downtown areas. Our initial pilot targets homeowners who are already renting informally (like Raj mentioned). We provide them with professional tools, insurance, and consistent revenue. Plus, our Tesla integration means premium customers and higher rates than informal arrangements.

## Questions to Ask (with Follow-ups):

**1. "Given your experience scaling infrastructure at massive companies, what do you see as the biggest technical challenges in building a real-time parking marketplace?"**
*Follow-up:* "How would you architect the system to handle peak demand periods, like rush hour in major metro areas?"

**2. "You mentioned understanding the fundraising journey - what metrics do you think will be most important to investors for a marketplace like this?"**
*Follow-up:* "Based on your Series A experience, what traction milestones should we hit before approaching VCs?"

**3. "With your consumer product launch experience, how do you balance building for Tesla's technical users versus making the app accessible to all drivers?"**
*Follow-up:* "What's your approach to user onboarding for a product that requires both technical integration and marketplace trust?"

**4. "You've worked on products used by hundreds of millions - how do you think about the operational complexity of managing physical spaces versus digital products?"**
*Follow-up:* "What systems would you put in place to handle disputes, no-shows, or property damage at scale?"
